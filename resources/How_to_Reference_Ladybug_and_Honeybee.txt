Ladybug and Honeybee are two open source plugins for environmental performance evaluation for Grasshopper3D for Rhino. Ladybug imports standard EnergyPlus Weather files (.EPW) into Grasshopper3D and provides a variety of 3D interactive graphics to support the decision-making process during the initial stages of design. Honeybee connects visual programming environment of Grasshopper3D to validated simulation engines, particularly, EnergyPlus, Radiance, Daysim and OpenStudio for building energy, comfort and daylighting simulation (Sadeghipour Roudsari M., Pak M., 2013). These plugins aim to enable dynamic couplings between flexible component-based visual programming interfaces and validated building performance simulation engines.
